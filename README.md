# The name

Ok, so maybe the name isn't great. But it's not supposed to be. This is my coursework for a module. It's OSS for many reasons
- I want to be able to show off my work
- I want it to be an example of some svelte components
- Why not?

For this coursework, your central and primary objective is to design a custom algorithm that combines two parallel issues: the shortest distance between two given points versus the safest route i.e. a route with the lowest risk and harm for pedestrians and other traffic for a self-driving car. These parallel issues will need to be combined into a single algorithm that effectively balances both. This balancing will be a crucial part of your design work.  This custom algorithm should be developed through a fictional town (Town 1). Once the algorithm is designed, you must then test and apply it to a different town (Town 2). Your poster should effectively showcase the operating algorithm, accompanied by supporting information of the algorithm's development. Aim to encapsulate appropriate aspects of the entire process. A critical aspect of this task is your capacity to exercise good judgement in both what you incorporate and what you omit from your poster. This entails making good choices regarding the inclusion of diagrams and the careful selection of textual content. Your poster should not merely offer information but should also demonstrate your ability to distil and communicate key insights and findings. It is imperative to underscore that the poster must not be a mere collection of slides; it must possess the autonomy to stand on its own, presenting your working algorithm.

Please note: In this coursework an algorithm is not code, nor is it pseudocode. An algorithm can be understood as a method, a way of solving a problem. It can be given as a diagram or a series of structured steps. It must be instructional and, for this coursework clear to a human user.

# The code
Svelte was an obvious choice as we had to write the app using pure CSS, the way it scopes CSS therefore makes it a lot easier to write. Therefore, sveltekit seemed like an obvious choice. When considering frameworks, I could've chosen to use Astro, however it seemed like overkill for what would essentially be a single page application.
