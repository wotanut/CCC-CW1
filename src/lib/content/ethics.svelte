        Utilitarianism

    <p>
        For this model, I chose to use Utilitarianism. I primarily chose this framework due to it prioritising the greatest good
        for the greatest amount of people. This means that the model will heavily prioritise saftey of the people in the towns
        over the saftey of the driver. As a result of this, the model is more likely to chose a route that is longer but safer
        over a route that is shorter and more dangerous.
    </p>

    <p>

        Furthermore, as this framework is a form of consequentialism, it is the only model that is able to partially predict the
        outcome of a route. This is because the model is able to weight the outcome of a route based on the danger it will incur.
        When compared to the other proposed ethical frameworks, utilitarianism is the only framework that is able to be applied
        algorithmically, making it the only suibtable framework for this project.
